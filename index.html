                <p class="text-faded">Damage in a structural system will lead to changes in the intrinsic properties such as natural frequencies. It is well known that the ratio of frequency changes in two modes is a function of the damage location. In this project, vibration data and static displacement measurements are used to detect and quantify structural damages. A sensitivity equation is developed by linearizing the perturbed system to study the sensitivity of natural frequencies and static displacements to the presence of a structural damage. An objective function representing a residual is defined using the sensitivity equation and minimized using the Cuckoo Search algorithm. The effectiveness of the technique is demonstrated with the help of cantilever beams and fixed–fixed beam where different damage scenarios are simulated and analyzed to obtain the modal parameters. In addition, a laboratory tested space frame model has been used to demonstrate the proposed technique. Numerical results indicate that damages can be accurately detected and quantified in a relatively shorter computational time using the Cuckoo Search algorithm. <span class="RlRed"></span></p>

  <h3 class="mt-4 mb-4"> Signal processing Coupled Regularization strategy for Indirect Health Monitoring of Bridges </h3>
  <p class="text-faded">This project involves the development of  a novel damage identification technique for bridges based on the dynamic response of a moving vehicle. A quarter car vehicle model instrumented with two accelerometers and an inertial profilometer is used for this purpose. The method involves the coupling of Tikhonov regularization scheme from inverse problem framework with signal averaging technique to handle the problem of measurement noise and road roughness. In the first stage, a damage-dependent road roughness profile is estimated from measured acceleration response by minimizing a Tikhonov regularized least squares cost function. The second stage involves the minimization of the profile roughness residual function that depends on the location and magnitude of damage. We prove mathematically and numerically that efficient damage detection ensues from considering multiple runs of the vehicle and choosing the appropriate regularization parameter. The present study considers various aspects, such as the uniqueness of results, robustness of results to measurement noise, effect of modelling error, effect of vehicle speed, and uncertainty in estimation. Numerical results show that the approach is capable of detecting the magnitude as well as the location of damage. In addition, the problem of road roughness and measurement noise is handled competently. <span class="RlRed"></span></p>

<h3 class="mt-4 mb-4"> State-Input Estimation in Dynamical Systems using Discrete Kalman Filter and Dynamic Programming Technique</h3>
<p class="text-faded">Roughness profile identification (Input excitation) is indispensable in vehicle dynamics research since it is the major source of excitation to the vehicle body. The present paper deals with pavement roughness identification based on the dynamic response of a quarter car vehicle model. The forward problem involves computing the vehicle responses using Newmark’s beta method. Noise in the measured data poses a serious challenge to the roughness identification problem. In this project, the computed dynamic responses are contaminated with Gaussian white noise in order to simulate actual field measurements. Two techniques are employed for identification, and their efficiency is compared. Roughness identification based on dynamic programming technique involves the formulation of an objective function that computes the least square error between measured and identified vehicle responses. Tikhonov regularization is incorporated to deal with the ill-posed inverse problem. Bellman’s principle of optimality is employed to minimize the objective function and compute the pavement roughness profile. In case of discrete Kalman filter-based identification, an optimal filter considering roughness as an unknown input rather than as a state variable is adopted. The efficiency of both methods in dealing with measurement error and estimation accuracy is compared. The computational efficiency and the feasibility of the two methods in tackling different scenarios in the identification problem are also demonstrated. <span class="RlRed"></span></p>
